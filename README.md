## The App
This app allows you to learn new russian words and practice for your examination. The words are grouped into topics to enrich your vocabulary step by step. With the additional background information about the vocabulary you can learn not only words but context for a topic and be prepared for your examination. <br>
With Vocablii you can learn Vocabulary anywhere at any time. 
<br> <b>Download the app now in the [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.navabase.Vocablii) and ios app store.</b>

### How it works
The app is fairly simple to use. Here is a short guide to give you an overview over the features the app offers.

#### Login
On the login page you have to enter your email and password and either sign up for a new account or log in with your existing account.

#### The home screen
On the home screen you have all your topics. You can simply click on one to open it or if you want to learn only new words swipe left and click on the icon. Swiping right lets you lern only known vocabulary. <br>

You can pull to refresh if you dont see all topics. <br>

On the bottom you have a settings button where you can log out, reset your progress or set a chunk size. If you choose some value other than 0 (all vocabulary available) you only lern the specified amout of vocabulary at once.

#### The Cards view
Once you have chosen one topic you get to the Card view. A card with a russian word is presented to you. If you know the translation for the word you can long press on the card and you will see the translation and some additional information about the vocabulary or the topic in general. With one of the three buttons at the bottom you can say if you knew the word (easy), you where unsure (naja...) or you didn´t knew it (wtf).
Once you know a word its card turns green, words you weren´t sure about are purple.<br>

If you want to skip a word you can just tap on the closed card. <br>

To go back to a previous word you can swipe left on a closed card. <br>

In order to get back to the home screen you can click on the title with the arrow pointing left.

#### For admins
If you are an admin you have a few additional features that allow you to curate the vocabulary in the app. On the home screen you have an add button that takes you to a screen where you can add new words, edit existing ones or delete words. To do so select the topic you want to edit and then type the word into the search box. If the word is already there you can edit the word, the translation and the context. If not you have to add the requierd information. <br>
After you entered / changed the vocabulary you can press the save button and your changes will be saved. <br>

If you find a mistake while learning you can press the edit button on the open card view below the translation of the vocabulary. The button will open a dialog where you can edit the information of this word. You can also delete the word with the delete button if you feel it is not nessesary for this topic.

| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
